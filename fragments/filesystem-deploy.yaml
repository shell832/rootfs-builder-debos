# All overlays in our recipes should copy their files to /overlay on the image.
# This recipe moves /overlay out of the image, overlays the files (basically
# "rsync -a /overlay/* /"), then deploys the filesystem as normal.
# In other words, overlay your files into "/overlay" then call this recipe
# in place of 'action: filesystem-deploy'

# Once this recipe completes, most actions acting on "/" are acting on the real
# image's root filesystem. However, the folder "/scratch/overlaydir" (outside
# of the image and without a chroot) contains the old overlay.
