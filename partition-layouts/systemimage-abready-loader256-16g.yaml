# Creates a 16GiB rootfs in the mainline system-image layout where:
# * The bootloader partition, 'loader', is placed at sector 256
# * There are _a and _b partitions for each of 'boot' and 'recovery'
# * The system partition is 2.5GB large
# * The cache partition is the same size as the system partition
# This enables future a/b updating

# Call this after your rootfs is ready for overlaying, it needs to place an
# fstab onto the rootfs.

# Set recovery_type_mount to "on" if you would like to mount a tmpfs as / and
# the partitions as their Android-style names (for example, the system partition
# is mounted as /system instead of /)
# recovery_type_mount will also prevent this recipe from performing tasks which
# would normally set up the rootfs image for this type of partitioning

# Remember to disable setup-fstab on filesystem-deploy when using this!
